						<h2>Population genomics...</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Genomic tools have revolutionized biology. Our lab uses techniques such as Restriction site-Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) 
					and whole-genome sequencing, combined with bioinformatics and mathematical modeling rooted in evolutionary genetics theory. Together with 
					minimally invasive sampling of DNA, these approaches can be used in natural populations to reveal insights about adaptation to 
					changing environments, population structure and phylogeography, disease resistance, inbreeding, the genetic basis of complex phenotypes, 
					hybridization, and population history.</p>

						<h2>...for conservation</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Our genomics projects focus on multiple threatened species of fish, mammals, birds, and other living things. Lab members are
					currently working on adaptation and genetic diversity in bulltrout, the capacity of predator-prey systems 
					to respond to climate change, persistence of pygmy rabbit populations experiencing climate change, hybridization and hatchery effects
					in trout, adaptation in burrowing owls, and more. Working with conservation practitioners, our goal is to provide useful scientific
					information for the management of threatened species and ecosystems.</p>
